 List Pagination and Filtering

 ## Description

The List Pagination and Filtering program displays students on a page based
on a constant variable which is the number of students to display on a page.
It reads through the list of students in the index.html file and adds a class
to each student to either hide (display: none) or show them. It also creates
pagination buttons at the bottom of the page, the number of these is dependent
on the number of students in the list. Clicking on a page button causes the
correct set of students to appear.

EXTRA CREDIT: Additionally, a search function has been added which allows the viewer to
search on a string of characters for a list of students. If there is no match,
or nothing is entered in the search field, a message is displayed that says
there is no match. If there are matches, a list of students is built and added
to the page.
